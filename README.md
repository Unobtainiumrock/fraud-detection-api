# Getting Started

## Docker Installation

- Follow the instructions here to install Docker [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

- **Note for Windows Users:**
Windows, you're on your own here. It is recommended to use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) to simplify the Docker installation and operation process. This approach is beneficial as it provides a Linux-like environment on Windows which is optimal for running Docker.

## Docker Compose Installation

[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Quick Setup Alternative for Ubuntu 20.0.4

### Docker Installation
Alternatively, here's a quick Ubuntu 20.0.4 process to get Docker up. (It's the only one I've tested)

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo docker run hello-world # Checks that Docker is installed correctly
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### Docker Compose Installation

```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version # verify installation and version
```

# Bulding & Running the Docker Container

`docker-compose up`

This command will start all services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that this file is set up correctly to define and configure services such as your FastAPI application and JupyterLab.
This can take awhile to run.

# Accessing Services

- **FastAPI Service:** Available at `http://localhost:8000`. The interactive API documentation generated by Swagger UI can be be accessed at `htttp://localhost:8000/docs`
- **JupyterLab:** Can be accessed at `http://localhost:8888` (retrieve the token from Docker logs).
