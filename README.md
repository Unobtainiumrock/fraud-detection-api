# Getting Started

## Docker Installation

- Follow the instructions here to install Docker [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

- **Note for Windows Users:**
Windows, you're on your own here. It is recommended to use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) to simplify the Docker installation and operation process. This approach is beneficial as it provides a Linux-like environment on Windows which is optimal for running Docker.

# Bulding & Running the Docker Container

`docker-compose up`

This command will start all services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that this file is set up correctly to define and configure services such as your FastAPI application and JupyterLab.

# Accessing Services

- **FastAPI Service:** Available at `http://localhost:8000`. The interactive API documentation generated by Swagger UI can be be accessed at `htttp://localhost:8000/docs`
- **JupyterLab:** Can be accessed at `http://localhost:8888` (retrieve the token from Docker logs).
