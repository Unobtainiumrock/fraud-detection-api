# Getting Started

## Docker Installation

- Follow the instructions here to install Docker [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

- **Note for Windows Users:**
Windows, you're on your own here. It is recommended to use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) to simplify the Docker installation and operation process. This approach is beneficial as it provides a Linux-like environment on Windows which is optimal for running Docker.

## Docker Compose Installation

[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Quick Setup Alternative for Ubuntu 20.0.4 (It's the only one I've tested)

Do both the Docker and Docker Compose Installations.

### Docker Installation

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo docker run hello-world # Checks that Docker is installed correctly
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### Docker Compose Installation

```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version # verify installation and version
```

## Bulding & Running the Docker Container

`docker-compose up`

This command will start all services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that this file is set up correctly to define and configure services such as your FastAPI application and JupyterLab.
This can take awhile to run.

# Accessing Services

- **FastAPI Service:** Available at `http://localhost:8000`. The interactive API documentation generated by Swagger UI can be be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **JupyterLab:** Can be accessed at `http://localhost:8888` (retrieve the token from Docker logs).

# About the Data Set

The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download) (provided by ULB). note: The context and content sections were taken directly from there.

## Context

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.


## Content

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.


### Key Points

Some key points to take from the content description are that:

1. **There is a class imbalance**: Fraudulent transactions are only $0.172%$ of the dataset, so standard accuracy metrics (like confusion matrix accuracy) aren't useful. This is why we should strongly consider using the area under the precision recall curve (**AUPRC**) --it will focus on how well the model identifies fraud (positive class)
2. **PCA-Transformed Features (V1-V28)**: These are numerical features, but since they've been transformed via PCA, we might not have direct interpretability regarding the original features. This should not affect the model's ability to learn from the data, but it may influence interpretability later on.
